Program to explore triband RGB combinations in hyperspectral data.
Allows you to select three bands from a hyperspectral image sequence and map them to RGB.

### Sliders:
**R, G, B**: Set which wavelengths to map to the red, green, and blue channels.  
**Base** and **Spread**: Another way to control the mapping, Base offsets the selected wavelengths and Spread is how far the selected wavelengths are apart. kinda like the wavelength equivalents of hue and saturation.  
**Saturation**:   
**White Balance**: 

Have fun exploring all the different colors you can bring out!
