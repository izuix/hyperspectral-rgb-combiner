Program to explore triband RGB combinations in hyperspectral data.
Allows you to select three bands from a hyperspectral image sequence and map them to RGB.  

### To get started
Select a folder containing your spectral image sequence.

### Sliders:
#### **R, G, B**:  
Set which wavelengths to map to the red, green, and blue channels.  
#### **Base** and **Spread**:  
Another way to control the mapping, Base offsets the selected wavelengths and Spread is how far the selected wavelengths are apart. kinda like the wavelength equivalents of hue and saturation.  
#### **Saturation**:  
With saturation you can bring out otherwise subtle color differences between close together wavelengths. (Reveal hidden colors inside green or blue for example!)  
#### **White balance** (color *Temperature* and *Tint*):  
Modifies the relative intensities between the channels. Tweak these sliders to bring out color contrast by correcting color casts.

Have fun exploring all the different colors you can bring out!
